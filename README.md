# Raspberry Pi Fleet Setup Playbook

This Ansible playbook automates the configuration and management of a fleet of Raspberry Pi devices. It includes network configuration, tool installations, custom setups for text processing, Emacs environment, and more.

## Features

- **Network Setup**: Configure Wi-Fi, access points, USB gadget mode, and more.
- **Tool Installations**: Install tools like Seafile, Tailscale, Babashka, and sync notifications.
- **Emacs Environment**: Build and install Emacs from source, along with Spacemacs and tmux service integration.
- **Text Processing**: Set up tools like Pandoc, TexLive, and Zettel Composer.
- **Diogenes & TLG**: Set up Diogenes with Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) data for ancient Greek texts.
- **Custom Git Repositories**: Manage personal Git repositories with credentials.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository** to your Ansible control node.
2. **Create a `credentials.yml`** file with sensitive information like Git credentials.
3. **Run the playbook** on your Raspberry Pi devices using:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i hosts playbook.yml
   ```
4. You can target specific features by using `--tags` with the appropriate tag(s).

## Requirements

- Ansible installed on the control node.
- SSH access to the Raspberry Pi devices (e.g., `orion`, `castor`).
- Devices running a Debian-based OS (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS).

## Example Commands

Run the full playbook:
```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

Run only Wi-Fi network configuration:
```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags wifi-networks
```

To run the Ansible playbook for a particular host, you can use the `--limit` option when executing the `ansible-playbook` command. Here's the basic syntax:

For example, if you want to run the playbook for the host `orion`, you would run:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --limit orion
```

This will limit the playbook execution to only the `orion` host defined in your inventory file.

## Example `credentials.yml`

Hereâ€™s an example of what your `credentials.yml` file should look like. This file stores sensitive information, such as passwords and network credentials, and should be kept secure. Make sure to protect it by restricting access permissions and avoid sharing it publicly.

```yaml
# Seafile configuration
seafile_password: "your_seafile_password"

# GitHub credentials for cloning private repositories
github_username: "your_github_username"
github_password: "your_github_password"

# Pushover credentials for sending notifications
pushover_app_token: "your_pushover_app_token"
pushover_user_key: "your_pushover_user_key"

# Wi-Fi networks configuration
wifi_networks:
  - name: home
    ssid: "your_home_wifi_ssid"
    psk: "your_home_wifi_password"
  - name: travel
    ssid: "your_travel_wifi_ssid"
    psk: "your_travel_wifi_password"
  - name: phone
    ssid: "your_phone_wifi_ssid"
    psk: "your_phone_wifi_password"

# Wi-Fi Access Point password
wifi_access_point_psk: "your_access_point_password"

# NAS (Network-Attached Storage) configuration
nas_user: "your_nas_username"
nas_password: "your_nas_password"
nas_host: "your_nas_host_address"
```

### Important Notes:
- Ensure the file is stored securely and not shared.
- Use proper file permissions (`chmod 600 credentials.yml`) to prevent unauthorized access.

### Encrypting Credentials with Ansible Vault

To further secure sensitive information, Ansible provides a way to encrypt the `credentials.yml` file using **Ansible Vault**. This allows you to encrypt and decrypt files containing confidential data, keeping your credentials safe even if the file is shared or stored in version control. You can encrypt the file with the following command:

```bash
ansible-vault encrypt credentials.yml
```

To edit the encrypted file later, use:

```bash
ansible-vault edit credentials.yml
```

And to run the playbook with an encrypted file, simply provide the vault password:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml --ask-vault-pass
```
